# Flashcards
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.
Stages:
1. Display information about a single card on the screen.
2. Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the userâ€™s answer on the screen.
3. Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.
4. Learn to use hashtables, display key values, and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.
5. Work with files: create a menu that allows you to add, delete, save, and upload saved cards in your game.
6. Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve.
7. Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments.


When you start the program, you are presented with a list of commands (add, remove, import, export, ask, exit, log, hardest card, reset stats)
Enter pairs of words separated by a space (add) or import from a ready-made text file (import) next line 'name_of_file.txt'
You can remove one of the cards with the command - (remove) next line (first word of card)
Run the test (ask)
After the test, check the statistics (hardest card)
Export response statistics to a text file (export) nextline (name_of_file.txt)
Save the log file(log) next line (name_of_file)
Reset statistics (reset stats)
exit...
